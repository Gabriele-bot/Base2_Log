# Base2_Log
This repository contains  
* the script that automatically generates the verilog file of a AXI4 lite compliant base2 logarithm
* output verilog file
* notebook with some tests  

In the future the PYNQ project and relative notebook will be added, in which some random inputs will be sent to the PL via a DMA, then the log will be computed and the result array will be sent back (via DMA again) and the error will be evaluated.
